# GENERAL

This is an audio addon for Kodi to enable access to the live streams and archived episodes for the radio station named [WFMU](http://wfmu.org). WFMU-FM is a listener-supported, non-commercial radio station broadcasting at 91.1 Mhz FM in Jersey City, NJ, right across the Hudson from lower Manhattan. It is currently the longest running freeform radio station in the United States.

The station maintains an extensive online presence at WFMU.ORG which includes live audio streaming in several formats, over 8 years of audio archives, podcasts and a popular blog

# COMPATIBILITY

I've only tested it with Kodi Version 14 (Helix). It should work with any platform, though.

# INSTALLATION

Download the latest release (a zip file), place it in a folder accessible to Kodi, then follow the instructions on the [Kodi Wiki](http://kodi.wiki/view/HOW-TO:Install_add-ons_from_zip_files)
